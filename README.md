# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Description

This project is an implementation of an AirBnB clone, featuring a command-line interpreter for managing AirBnB objects. The project includes various classes such as User, State, City, Place, Amenity, and Review, all inheriting from a base class named BaseModel. Additionally, an abstracted storage engine (File Storage) is provided for serialization and deserialization of instances.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter allows users to perform operations on AirBnB objects through a shell-like interface. Users can create new objects, retrieve objects from storage, perform operations, update attributes, and destroy objects.

### How to Start the Command Interpreter

To start the command interpreter, run the following command:

```bash
$ ./console.py
```

### How to Use the Command Interpreter

Once in interactive mode, the prompt `(hbnb)` indicates that the interpreter is ready to receive commands. Use documented commands (type `help <topic>`) such as `EOF`, `help`, and `quit`.

### Examples

#### Interactive Mode

```bash
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) create User
(hbnb) show User 1234-5678-9012
(hbnb) update User 1234-5678-9012 email "user@example.com"
```

#### Non-Interactive Mode

```bash
$ echo "create User" | ./console.py
$ echo "show User 1234-5678-9012" | ./console.py
$ echo "update User 1234-5678-9012 email 'user@example.com'" | ./console.py
```
